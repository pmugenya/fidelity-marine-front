LOGO NOT SHOWING? CLEAR BROWSER CACHE!
========================================

EVERYTHING IS CORRECT:
- Logo file exists: logo.svg (35 KB)

   - Or: Ctrl + Shift + P (Firefox)

STEP 2: Navigate

SOLUTION 5: DIFFERENT BROWSER
========================================

Try opening in:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Edge
- Any browser you haven't used yet

========================================
CHECK IF IT WORKED
========================================

After clearing cache, you should see:

1. Splash Screen (loading page)
   - Fidelity logo with teal and lime colors

2. Sign-In Page
   - Left side: "Fidelity Insurance" with logo
   - Login form: Fidelity logo at top

3. Marine Cargo Form
   - Header: "Fidelity Marine" with logo

4. Travel Quote Form
   - Header: "Fidelity Travel" with logo

5. Dashboard
   - Sidebar: Fidelity logo at top

========================================
STILL NOT WORKING?
========================================

If logo still doesn't appear after clearing cache:

1. Check Browser Console
   - Press F12
   - Click "Console" tab
   - Look for errors about logo.svg
   - Take a screenshot and share it

2. Check Network Tab
   - Press F12
   - Click "Network" tab
   - Refresh page (F5)
   - Look for "logo.svg" request
   - Check if it's 200 (success) or 404 (not found)

3. Verify URL
   - Make sure you're on: http://localhost:4200
   - Not: http://127.0.0.1:4200 (different cache)

========================================
MOST COMMON ISSUE: BROWSER CACHE!
========================================

99% of the time, the logo doesn't show because:
- Browser cached the OLD broken image
- Browser is showing cached version
- Need to clear cache to see NEW logo

SOLUTION: Clear cache using any method above!
